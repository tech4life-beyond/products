# Contributing to `products`

This repository contains Product Packs (documentation + artifacts) for Tech4Life & Beyond.

## Workflow
1. Create a branch from `main`
2. Make focused changes
3. Open a Pull Request
4. Ensure required CI checks pass
5. Merge only after required reviewers approve

## Product Pack rules (high level)
- Each product lives in its own top-level folder (a "Product Pack")
- Product Packs must satisfy the canonical Product Creation Pipeline requirements
- All licensing and registration documents must be consistent with TOIL

## CI expectations
Before opening a PR, confirm:
- Product Pack validation passes
- Registry sync trigger (if applicable) is not broken
- No secrets are committed
- Links and file paths resolve
