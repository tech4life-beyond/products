# ADR-0001: Repository governance baseline

## Context
The `products` repository contains product packs that may be relied on for licensing, due diligence, and downstream automation.

## Decision
Adopt a governance baseline in-repo:
- Root LICENSE (TOIL) present
- CODEOWNERS present
- SECURITY / SUPPORT / CODE_OF_CONDUCT / CONTRIBUTING present
- PR template for compliance

## Consequences
- Better auditability and onboarding
- Clear accountability for changes
