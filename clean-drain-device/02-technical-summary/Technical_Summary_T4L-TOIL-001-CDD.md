# Technical Summary
## Clean Drain Device (DrainClean T Adapter)

---

## 1. Overview

The **Clean Drain Device** is an inline HVAC condensate drain adapter designed to provide **early clog detection, backflow prevention, and proactive maintenance access** within condensate drain lines.

It integrates mechanical flow control, visual inspection, and optional electrical signaling into a single compact component compatible with standard HVAC drain configurations.

---

## 2. System Context

Condensate drain systems are critical to HVAC operation but are prone to blockage due to:
- Algae and biofilm buildup
- Debris accumulation
- Improper slope or installation

Failure typically manifests only after overflow occurs. The Clean Drain Device introduces **pre-failure visibility and intervention capability**.

---

## 3. Physical Architecture

### 3.1 Body Structure

- Inline T-adapter configuration
- Transparent or semi-transparent housing for visual inspection
- Standard threaded or slip-fit connections compatible with PVC drain lines

The transparent body allows technicians and users to visually assess flow conditions without disassembly.

---

### 3.2 Internal Flow Control

- Directional internal valve or flow-restricting geometry
- Designed to limit reverse flow and backpressure
- Maintains normal gravity-based drainage during standard operation

The internal geometry is optimized to avoid introducing new clog points.

---

### 3.3 Maintenance & Flush Port

- Threaded access port integrated into the adapter body
- Enables:
  - Manual flushing
  - Compressed air cleaning
  - Chemical or water-based maintenance

This port allows maintenance **without disconnecting** the drain line.

---

## 4. Sensor & Signaling Capability (Optional)

The Clean Drain Device supports optional sensing mechanisms, including:

- Float-based activation
- Reed switch or Hall-effect sensor
- Mechanical trigger linked to fluid level

When triggered, the device can:
- Send a signal to shut down HVAC equipment
- Activate an alarm or alert system

Sensor integration is modular and does not affect core mechanical operation.

---

## 5. Installation Configurations

- Vertical installation
- Horizontal installation
- Upstream or downstream placement relative to drain pan

The device is designed to operate effectively in residential and light commercial HVAC systems.

---

## 6. Operational Behavior

### Normal Operation

- Condensate flows freely through the adapter
- No electrical activation
- Visual confirmation of normal flow

### Early Clog Condition

- Reduced or altered flow becomes visually apparent
- Fluid level changes may activate sensor

### Maintenance Mode

- Flush port accessed
- Blockage cleared without system disassembly

---

## 7. Safety & Reliability Considerations

- No moving parts required for base functionality
- Sensor systems are optional and fail-safe
- Device does not restrict normal drainage when properly installed

Materials are selected to withstand typical HVAC condensate environments.

---

## 8. Compatibility

- Standard PVC drain line sizes
- Compatible with common HVAC systems
- Designed for retrofit and new installations

---

## 9. Differentiation

The Clean Drain Device differentiates itself by combining:
- Visual inspection
- Preventative signaling
- Integrated maintenance access

into a **single inline component**, reducing failure response time and service costs.
