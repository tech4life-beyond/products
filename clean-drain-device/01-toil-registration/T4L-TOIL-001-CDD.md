## 3. Problem Statement

HVAC condensate drain line blockages are a frequent and costly failure point that can result in:

- Water overflow and property damage
- Mold growth and health risks
- Equipment shutdowns and service interruptions

Existing solutions typically respond only after overflow has occurred and do not enable proactive inspection or preventative maintenance.

## 4. Solution Overview

The **Clean Drain Device** is a compact, inline HVAC condensate drain adapter designed to:

- Enable early clog detection
- Prevent backflow
- Allow direct flushing and maintenance
- Provide full visual inspection of internal flow

The device integrates mechanical flow control, optional sensor activation, and a maintenance access port into a single transparent adapter.

- Directional internal valve to restrict backflow
- Sensor-trigger mechanism (reed switch, Hall sensor, or float-based variants)
- Electrical signal output for HVAC system shutdown
- Threaded flush / maintenance port
- Optional additional ports for system compatibility

The device operates effectively in both vertical and horizontal installations.
