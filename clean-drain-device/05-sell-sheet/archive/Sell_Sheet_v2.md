## Prevent Costly HVAC Water Damage — Before It Happens

### A Simple Inline Device That Enables Visual Inspection, Proactive Maintenance, and Early Clog Detection

Condensate drain line failures are one of the most common and expensive HVAC service issues. Overflow, mold, emergency calls, and property damage occur **after** the clog has already formed.

**The Clean Drain Device prevents that failure point.**

---

## The Problem

- Condensate drain clogs are hard to detect early
- Traditional solutions react *after* overflow occurs
- Service calls are costly and disruptive
- Property damage and mold claims increase liability

Existing drain solutions offer limited visibility, no proactive flushing, and minimal prevention capability.

---

## The Solution

The **Clean Drain Device** is a compact, inline HVAC condensate drain adapter that:

- Provides **full visual inspection** of internal flow
- Enables **early clog detection** before overflow
- Allows **direct flushing and maintenance**
- Prevents **backflow** through an internal directional valve
- Supports **optional sensor integration** for system shutdown or alerts

All functions are integrated into **one simple transparent adapter**.

---

## Key Features

- Transparent body for instant visual confirmation
- Directional internal valve to restrict backflow
- Threaded maintenance / flush port
- Optional sensor-ready architecture (reed, Hall, float variants)
- Electrical output for HVAC system shutdown (optional)
- Works in vertical or horizontal installations
- Minimal installation complexity

---

## Key Benefits (For Manufacturers & Distributors)

- Reduces warranty claims and callbacks
- Lowers liability related to water damage
- Differentiates HVAC systems and accessories
- Easy to manufacture and integrate
- No software dependency required
- Supports preventative maintenance positioning

This device shifts HVAC maintenance from **reactive to preventative**.
