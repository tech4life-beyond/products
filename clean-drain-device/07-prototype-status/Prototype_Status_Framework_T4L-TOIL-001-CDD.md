## 3. Next Prototype Milestones

### Phase 1 – Engineering Validation

- Create detailed CAD model
- Validate dimensions against standard HVAC drain lines
- Internal flow simulation (if applicable)
- Confirm valve mechanics feasibility

### Phase 2 – Rapid Prototype

- 3D print mechanical housing
- Test internal valve function
- Evaluate water flow under simulated clog conditions

### Phase 3 – Functional Integration (Optional Sensor Variant)

- Integrate float, reed switch, or Hall sensor
- Validate electrical trigger logic
- Confirm compatibility with HVAC shutoff systems

---

## 4. Validation Criteria

The prototype will be considered validated when:

- No leakage occurs under normal operating conditions
- Backflow prevention mechanism performs consistently
- Flush port functions without structural failure
- Installation compatibility is confirmed

---

## 5. Manufacturing Engagement Path

Upon successful prototype validation:

1. Prepare manufacturing-ready CAD package
2. Create BOM draft
3. Identify potential manufacturers
4. Request tooling estimates
5. Evaluate production cost per unit

---

## 6. Risk Assessment

Current risks include:

- Mechanical tolerance misalignment
- Valve failure under long-term use
- Material compatibility with condensate

Mitigation will occur during engineering validation phase.

---

## 7. Ethical Compliance During Prototyping

Prototype development must:

- Avoid unsafe electrical testing
- Follow material safety standards
- Avoid misleading performance claims during testing

---

## 8. Status Summary

The Clean Drain Device is currently in:

**Pre-Prototype Engineering Phase**

Next actionable step: Develop CAD model and initiate mechanical validation.
