## 1. Ethical Commitment

Kivai is designed to improve human control over technology through open standards, interoperability, and safety-first execution contracts.

Kivai must not be used to enable harm, exploitation, or unauthorized control of devices.

---

## 2. Safety-First Execution

Kivai promotes deterministic execution patterns:

- Standardized intent formats reduce ambiguity
- Validation layers reduce unsafe command execution
- Explicit fields enable policy enforcement (zones, permissions, constraints)

---

## 3. Authorization and Trust Principles

Kivai’s design supports:

- Device-level authorization requirements for sensitive actions
- Trust boundaries between devices and environments
- Auditable intent structures and logs (where implemented)

Kivai should never be deployed in a way that bypasses user consent or device security.

---

## 4. Anti-Abuse and Misuse Prevention

Prohibited or disallowed deployments include:

- Unauthorized surveillance or tracking systems
- Covert control mechanisms
- Exploitative integrations designed to bypass privacy or security

If misuse is identified, Tech4Life & Beyond LLC reserves the right to enforce TOIL ethical clauses and revoke commercial permissions.

---

## 5. Human Agency and Transparency

Kivai is designed to preserve human agency:

- Clear user intent representation
- Predictable outcomes
- Transparent execution pathways

Users should be able to understand what a device is about to do, and why.

---

## 6. Alignment with Tech4Life Mission

Kivai aligns with Tech4Life & Beyond’s commitment to:

- Preventative innovation
- Ethical technology development
- Non-exploitative commercial models
- Open interoperability standards that reduce vendor lock-in
